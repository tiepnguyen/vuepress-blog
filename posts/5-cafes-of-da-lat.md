**Still Cafe**


A popular place among young people, the café on Nguyen Trai Street capitalizes on tranquillity and good drinks. It is in a wooden house with a small courtyard in front and a garden at the back. Many young people use it as a background for their Facebook and Instagram photos.

**Mr. Ba Ba Ba**


The small café is located near Than Tho Lake (the Lake of Sighs) on Nam Ho Street, far from the center. Inside, the place is designed to look like a garden with plants all over the place.

Wooden furniture and items in the shop create a sense of easy familiarity: it was how many Vietnamese homes looked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There is a piano and a guitar available for anyone who wants to play songs.

There are many popular varieties of tea and coffee, starting at VND25,000 ($1.1).


**Violet on the Fourth Day café**


After being abandoned for a long time, this villa on Tran Hung Dao Street has got a new lease of life. Customers can either sit inside or in the garden.
